# track

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive life-tracking app designed to help users monitor and manage different aspects of their daily routines and personal goals in one place. The primary goal is to simplify tracking by combining multiple features into a single, easy-to-use platform.

The initial priorities for the app are:
	1.	Expense Tracking – Helping users record, categorize, and analyze their spending habits. This feature will offer insights into where money is going, set budgets, track savings, and generate detailed reports for better financial management.
	2.	Habit Tracking – Enabling users to build and maintain positive habits by setting goals, tracking progress, and providing reminders or motivational feedback. This feature will help users stay consistent and visualize their growth over time.

Eventually, the app could expand to include other tracking tools like fitness, mood, or time management, but the immediate focus will be on delivering an efficient and seamless experience for expense and habit tracking.
